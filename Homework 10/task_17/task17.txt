BufferedReader is synchronous while Scanner is not. BufferedReader should be used if we are working with multiple threads.
BufferedReader has significantly larger buffer memory than Scanner.
The Scanner has a little buffer (1KB char buffer) as opposed to the BufferedReader (8KB byte buffer), but itâ€™s more than enough.
BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to scanner because scanner does parsing of input data and BufferedReader simply reads sequence of characters.
